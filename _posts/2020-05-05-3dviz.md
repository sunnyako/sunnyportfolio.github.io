# Background

This tool serves as an interactive visual aid for data analysis. Our
goals were to create a visualization tool for introducing users to the
data. The vision is to start from a higher level view of the data and to
give tools to users to explore certain attributes in more detail. The
purpose of the tool is to create a visually appealing interface to
inspire researchers to explore the data in unique ways, allowing for
novel observations. Some of the projects that inspired this method came
from other disciplines such as Biology and Astronomy, where the study of
natural phenomena relies on interactive 3D models when studying the
[molecular structure of compounds](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://molview.org/&sa=D&ust=1604444321335000&usg=AOvVaw1mE5pt6eWjsEWAaTyv9qqm) or
[visualizing an exploding star](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wallaby-survey.org/3d-visualization/&sa=D&ust=1604444321335000&usg=AOvVaw1Z1BSv0HTwJbdl5gaPpGwA).
We wanted to explore Social Science data with similar tools to see the
kind of new capabilities that they might provide into understanding the
data. One of the turning points was making the shift from 2D to 3D.

### How Using 3D Visualizations Enhances Data

-   Improves recall and comprehension of data (according to
    [research](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/hci-design-at-uw/explaining-the-gap-visualizing-ones-predictions-improves-recall-and-comprehension-of-data-ec848d5861d9&sa=D&ust=1604444321336000&usg=AOvVaw0tIk3EAsANZuQ1RMiSEnlL))
-   Overcomes the limitations of 2D representations by allowing
    multidimensional data through space and color
-   Used extensively in driving scientific research
    *Ex*: used for general structure representations with
[COVID-19](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ami.org/press/press-releases/2020/402-medical-and-scientific-visualization-of-covid-19&sa=D&ust=1604444321336000&usg=AOvVaw2cnG2p4sTTdWiFVqxSETT5).

## General Advice for Future Students


### Mistakes to avoid

-   Be careful about merging too many branches together at once and
    committing too many changes. Make sure that everyone is aware of
     the changes being made to the code.
-   Always add comments for every line of code that is written (when
    working as a team, this makes it easier for others to understand the
    logic of the code).
-   Make sure to keep code clean, styled, and dry
-   Keep up with two goals in the code
    -   Make sure it works
    -   Make sure it’s readable

### Tips that saved time

-   Picking a specific feature for each person to focus on
-   Reduced conflicts and increased work efficiency
-   Outline functions bugs/to-dos in the beginning of each file
-   Commenting whenever possible to upkeep clarity of code
-   Commenting out a piece of code to see what errors come up and to
    understand what it is doing
-   Use of examples/ready made code
-   Using what we already had as much as possible as opposed to
    scrapping code
-   Using Github to keep track of the last changes that were made to the
    code. This helps to identify a specific change that is causing an
    error.
-   Focus on specific elements of D3 or other libraries instead of
    trying to become an expert in it. Learn what you need as you go.
-   Know what you want to implement and then break it down into gradual
    steps.
    -   What do you want to implement?
    -   How will it accomplish this function?
      -   i.e. Get JSON \> Convert \> Select data subset \> convert to
    coordinate \> display as visual
-   Implement it step by step and check for functionality along the way
-   Don’t bite off more than you can chew

### What We Would Do Differently

-   Change the structure of the data and the JSON
-   Organizing code better and commenting consistently
-   Setting up coding environments and working with git branches sooner
-   Learning to use some other libraries to supplement the D3 on 3D
    graphs, such as:
    -   [D3-3d](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/Niekes/d3-3d&sa=D&ust=1604444321349000&usg=AOvVaw3D05yt7D4Ce3MK0A9aoc_S) (used
    in this project)
    -   [X3dom](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.x3dom.org/&sa=D&ust=1604444321350000&usg=AOvVaw361a_l0UAjNmVsuML8HpQM) (worth
    trying in the future)

## Next Steps

-   Working button for interacting with the database
-   Creating snapshots of views/data
-   Using a button to display the skills needed for a specific field/job
-   Improving efficiency and functionality
-   Allowing for further analysis of data
  -   i.e. linking to team 2’s project

## Use for Final Product

-   Serves as the initial step in exploring the HEJP database
-   Allows for the creation of more detailed live queries to the
    database

### Future Goals +3 months

-   Modify views of 0 jobs cubes
-   Create multiple js files for each feature (cubes, tooltip, legend,
    grid)
-   Better styling
-   More accurate placement of the various svgs and features in html
    file:

-   tooltip/cube visualization/color legend

-   By clicking on a specific cube, we can make a deeper investigation
    in that field, having a secondary graph showing information related
    to it.

### Before and After Lockdown

-   During lockdown, we had meaningful discussions on online learning
    tools and what skills are necessary to present to a virtual
    audience.
-   Screen-sharing proved to be useful for meetings and team debugging
    sessions.
-   It was easier to arrange time to meet on a weekly basis since we all
    could meet through Zoom.
-   Not many changes to workflow overall, since we communicated through
    Zoom and shared our code through GitHub.

# How to Run

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install and how to install them:
-   **Python 3.X**
  -   This setup requires that your machine has python 3.X installed on
    it. You can refer to [Download
    Python](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.python.org/downloads/&sa=D&ust=1604444321353000&usg=AOvVaw1vNxUSCBQFL7ivNuO9_he3) to
    download Python 3
-   **Brackets**
  -   We used the Brackets Editor to work on our project. Brackets allowed
    us to easily and instantly see the visualization of our current code
    by clicking on a button found on the top right corner of the editor.
    This was easier than using a python server.
      -   Link to the Brackets Editor:
    [brackets.io](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://brackets.io&sa=D&ust=1604444321354000&usg=AOvVaw1I8vBAuMk_P8buMWNkquH5)


## Tips for Git

Some useful tips if you are working with Git for the first time:
-   Every time you start working, make sure to get the most
    updated version of code. For example, if you want to pull the newest
    version code of eda3d branch, you need to pull it to you local
    machine by running:

                git pull origin eda3d

-   After you are satisfied with what you worked on your local machine,
     you will first stages all changes locally, and then commit it so
    everyone will be able to see it:

                git add -A
                git commit -m “some message describing what you did”

-   To check which branch you are working on or the status of the
    branch, run:

                git status

-   To show all the branches, run:

                 git branch
